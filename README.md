## 🧠 Business Problem
Mobile retailers and analysts often face challenges in answering key business questions such as:
- Which mobile brands and models generate the highest revenue?
- Which cities contribute the most to total sales?
- How do sales vary across months and weekdays?
- What payment methods are preferred by customers?
- Does customer rating influence overall sales performance?

Raw transactional data alone makes it difficult to extract such insights.  
This dashboard converts raw data into **actionable, visual insights**.
